## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Machine leaning alrorithms

- **Supervised learning**(监督学习): used most in real-world applications.
- **Unsupervised learning**
- **Recommender systems**
- **Reinforcement learning**

###Supervised learning

**Supervised learning**(监督学习): Learn from being given “right answers”

| Regression(回归)                  | Classification(分类)              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Predict a number                  | Predict categories                |
| infinitely many possible outputs. | small number of possible outputs. |

### Unsupervised learning

**Unsupervised learning**:Find Something interesting in unlabeled data.

**clustering algorithm**: a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters.
